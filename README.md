# SQL Table Script Generator
This repository contains a SQL Server stored procedure that generates table creation scripts. 
The stored procedure takes a table name as input and generates the SQL script to create the table, including columns, data types. 
It also provides the option to save the generated scripts in a dedicated table for future reference. 
This tool simplifies the process of creating SQL table scripts and enhances database schema documentation.
